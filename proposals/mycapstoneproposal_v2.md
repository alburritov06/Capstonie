# Capstone Proposal

The Capstone is a web application that touches on every major technology we covered: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. Below are the criteria for your proposal. It's difficult to be certain how long each feature will take to develop. Therefore you should plan out multiple 'milestones' for your project. That way, if you reach milestone 2 but not 3, you still have something worthwhile to present and be proud of. It also gives you the opportunity to plan out what you'd like to work on after the class is finished. I can help you sculpt out an idea, and I'll tell you very plainly whether a goal is attainable given our time constraints. I highly recommend doing some sketches of pages. This document is for you as much as it is for me. By planning thoroughly and precisely, the implementation will be much easier. Please do not change your idea after we start working on our capstones, it wastes your time and your end result won't be as good. Your proposal is due by the time we start our capstones (3-4 weeks before the end of the course).

- Your proposal must be in a markdown `.md` file [more info](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
- Your proposal must set specific and attainable goals
- Your proposal must cover all major topics we've covered
- Your proposal must include the sections below



## Name

**Live Cheap or Party Free**

## Project Overview

**What are the major features of your web application?**

- home page map display of "day of" cheap or free events (including volunteering).
- search bar that can display like events
- anything not "day of" will be displayed in different colors
- features will disappear as the end time of the event expires
- certain events will have icons
- hover boxes that show event details

**What problem is it attempting to solve?**

- last minute plan making for poor people
- opportunities for organizations and communities to have a place to display their cheap happenings in a really nice format

**What libraries or frameworks will you use?**

- *Need to understand how to better approach figuring this part out*

## Functionality

**Walk through the application from the user's perspective.**

- Wow, I just realized I'm a young or old person and have nothing better to do than make friends cheaply near me. I wonder if there's an app that just displays all the possible cheap options all in one place... BAM! Live Cheap or Party Free (still have to come up with an actual name).. I can see all these different things i could do with the community and with easy to see discriptions and locations. My life is totally different now :)

**What will they see on each page?**

- Trying to go with one page that displays todays events and if they search something specific it can just display those results.. possibly multiple pages for a max of a month out. The front page might have a little key in the top left corner with popular icon key values. nav bar on the side with options to save, create.

**What can they input and click and see?**

- They'll see icons populate the page that are like or similar to whatever they are looking for. Input all of their details for their event with a manditory expiration datetime field.

**How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?**

- I'm hoping that my back end will be able to successfully populate the page with results similar to whatever they search for. I think that's going to take a lot but im not sure. They should be able to save and be notified and also add events

## Data Model

**What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.**

- events, images, user info,

## Schedule

**Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.**

- *Also would like help on this*
